      <h2>What is Rula?</h2>
      <p>Rula is a ret-system similar to Google, developed with consideration of the flaws in other systems. I am an independent developer, personally interested in the system's progress and its positive reputation. The system runs at zero cost. At the same time, I do not earn a cent from it either. At the bottom of the page, you'll find an email address where you can send any suggestions or questions.</p>

      <h3>Welcome Welta 0.5 and Rosto Mail 0.1</h3>
      <p>A new system update has been released! From now on, the system includes Rosto Mail. For now, it is a tool for account management and private communication between users. Anyone using Rula services is now required to have Rosto installed. We took all profile-related functions from Welta, packaged them, and moved them to Rosto, removing them from Welta to save users' memory. Now, our system truly works as a unified system. In Welta, pressing the profile button will open the profile in the Rosto app. Therefore, for the system to function properly, you must be logged in with the same account across all services. Bugs have also been fixed.</p>

          <h3>Welta 0.5</h3>
          <p>Welta was the very first Rula service. It was used to test all the core features of the system.</p>
          <p>There are many people doing something they love. With this app, people with shared interests living nearby can find each other.</p>
          <p>With the release of version 0.5, Welta introduces long-awaited filters. Now you can filter messages by interest. For example, if you want to chat about football, simply type "football" in the "filters" field, confirm, and you'll chat with others who selected the same keyword. You can do the same with cities or regions to find local people, and so on.</p>

          <h3>Rosto 0.1</h3>
          <p>Rosto is the mail system and the main service of Rula. It enables user communication.</p>
          <p>Messages are sent not to a real email address but to a RulaID. This keeps your real email safe.</p>
          <p>In the future, messages will be filterable by various criteria. For now, it simply offers internal communication within the system.</p>

          <h3>Why Rula?</h3>
          <p>Rula is a unique system rightly called a "ret-system", which literally means "net-system". This reflects the organization and cohesion of all its services.</p>
          <p>Rula also wins technically: its services receive functional updates twice as fast as those from large, slow-moving corporations, yet never ship with bugs.</p>
          <p>Rula hides your real email address from other users, keeping it safe. Instead, to sign your actions like messages, Rula uses your unique identifier - a kind of login-called RulaID.</p>
