# üåê Official Rula RetSystem Website

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the **official website** of the **Rula RetSystem**.

The website serves as the central information hub, explaining the Rula philosophy, outlining the system's benefits, and introducing its core services, such as **Welta (Forum)** and **Rosto Mail (Mail & Account Management)**. The site is crucial for communicating the system's commitment to being **More Convenient\! Safer\! Better\!**

## ‚ú® Website Purpose

The primary goal of the website is to clearly and accessibly present Rula as a unique **"ret-system"** (net-system) that achieves its goals by:

1.  **Explaining Security:** Highlighting that Rula **hides the user's real email address** by using the secure identifier **RulaID**.
2.  **Demonstrating Unity:** Showing how services like **Welta** and **Rosto** function as a single, cohesive, integrated organism.
3.  **Emphasizing Philosophy:** Informing users that the system operates at **zero cost** and **without commercial gain**, focusing purely on quality and community benefit.
4.  **Delivering News:** Providing fast updates on the system's rapid, **bug-free feature releases**.
